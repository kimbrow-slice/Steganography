                        <h3>With a technique called <strong>Steganography</strong></h3>
                        <p> Although the term was first used was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius, modern Steganography entered the world in 1985. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file image or video.</p>

                        <p>Typically, the message that is hidden looks to be part of something else. Like with the example above, being unnoticeable, by staying visible in a setting that masks presence. Steganographic encrypted messages don't attract as
                            much attention as using conventional cryptography. Unless the person viewing the file knows to look for it, they wouldn't know that anything even happened. Sadly, it hasn't always been this easy. In the early days of the printing
                            press, it was common to mix different typefaces on a printed page because the printer did not have enough copies of some letters in one typeface. Thus, a message could be hidden by using two or more different typefaces, such
                            as normal or italic. Moving forward into history during World War II a spy for Japan by the name of Velvalee Dickinson, was in New York City. She would send information to accommodation addresses in neutral South America. She
                            happened to sells dolls, and her letters would discuss the quantity and type of dolls to ship. The stegotext was the doll orders, and the concealed "plaintext" was itself encoded and gave information about ship movements.</p>

                        <p>With the digital world we live in, JavaScript has enabled us to find an easier way for us to be able to accomplish this task. Thanks to the Steganography.js library created by <a class="a" href="www.peter-eigenschink.at">Peter Eigenschink</a>.
